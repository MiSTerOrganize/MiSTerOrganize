# MiSTer Organize
Welcome to my project called MiSTer Organize. I'm providing you a custom MiSTer_Console DAT each month. The goal of this project is to make MiSTer as easy to use as possible. Is your MiSTer SD or external drive a disorganized mess with files all over the place? Can't find the game you're looking for to play? The MiSTer_Console DAT contains A-Z folders to sort your games alphabetically for easy use. Put an end to the nightmare of messy file structures and games not working. Try MiSTer Organize and notice the improved difference in your MiSTer setup.

This project uses RomVault to manage your ROMs. If you have no experience with RomVault, I have provided a basic RomVault setup for you to use. The project sources are in a Notepad text document with the most recent date at top. You can view all the folders and files for the project in the provided snapshot HTML file. It also has a built-in search functionality. This is nice to have if you are on the go and want to browse your game collection.

# What is a DAT?
Short for "data files", they're called DATs or DAT files because they usually have the extension .dat. They contain a catalog of titles and attributes for each of its titles, including file names, hashes, and sizes.

Used in combination with a ROM manager, the information in a DAT file can be used to audit files on your hard drive to ensure that they are named correctly, and that they match the recorded attributes in the file.

DAT files usually follow one of two standards: either a variant on the XML-based LogiqX format, or the less commonly used CLRMAMEPro format. There are many more less common formats.

# What is RomVault?
RomVault is a tool for ROM management. It works with DAT files to sort the ROMs into folders. The DAT I provide is telling the files where they need to go. Let’s take the example of the Shinobi Neo Geo game. When you click Fix ROMs, Shinobi Neo Geo will go into the Neo Geo Core folder and then into the Unlicensed games folder. This all happens because that is the file destination I have set in the DAT file.
